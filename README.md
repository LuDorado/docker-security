# Securing Containers
Final lab for the "Container Security" specialization

## Running Multiple Containers with Docker Compose

I have generated and uploaded three hardened security images corresponding to:

* Front End
* API Layer
* Database

You can find the code to create those images in the "images" folder. also, you have a docker-compose.yaml file to test the code locally
